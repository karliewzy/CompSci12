I coded this game during my last year of high school. :)

Welcome to the Snake Game project! 

Control a hungry snake on its mission to devour apples and grow longer. Customize your settings, choose your mode, and press the SPACE KEY to start. 

## Instructions

- Configure settings and modes from the menu bar.
- Pause and resume with the SPACE KEY.
- Restart the game anytime.

## Game Modes

Choose from various game modes to keep things interesting:

- **Wall Mode**: Avoid walls created after eating apples.
- **Speed Challenge Mode**: Snake gets faster after each apple.
- **Classic Mode**: The default Snake Game mode.

## Snake Settings

Customize your snake according to your preferences:

- **Short Snake**: Starts with a snake composed of 2 blocks.
- **Classic Snake**: The default snake with a length of 6 blocks.
- **Large Snake**: Begin with an impressive 10-block-long snake.
- **Colorful Snake**: Add a touch of vibrancy to your snake with a colorful body. You can select this option while choosing different snake lengths.

Enjoy the Snake Game!
